## Description  
AzeWalks is a **C# Web API** that I’m building to manage and provide information about the **tracks and trails of Azerbaijan**. 

## Technical Details  
So far, I have:  
- Completed the **Region Controller**  
- Implemented **full CRUD operations** for the **Region model**  
- Used **DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)** for the **Region model and controller** to keep things structured  

## Development Status  
I’m still working on this project and will continue adding new features like JWT tokens, a UI, filtering, sorting, and pagination over time.
